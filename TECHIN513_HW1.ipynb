        "The wrong sampling frequency can significantly alter the audio's pitch, speed, and quality, resulting in a listening experience that is markedly different from what was intended by the creators of the audio content. When the incorrect sampling frequency is used to play back an audio file, several noticeable changes can occur in the audio's characteristics. The sampling frequency, or sample rate, is a crucial parameter in digital audio that determines how many samples of the audio signal are captured per second."

For instance, if the first increases amplitude, the second might decrease it or add an effect like reverb. Setting a segment of the signal, s1, to a value of 2 for the [0, 0.5] time range would amplify that part of the signal, increasing its loudness."
